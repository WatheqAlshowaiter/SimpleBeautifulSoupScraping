# A Simple BeautifulSoup Scraping
A python code for scraping Wordpress site using BeautifulSoup library

The code is based on the video tutorial [Python Tutorial: Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup and Requests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng2o98k983k&t=20s&ab_channel=CoreySchafer) which is very nice and simple for beginners.

I follow the code and the tutorial and I moved one step forward: scrape thw whole site with the pagination, not only the first page.
